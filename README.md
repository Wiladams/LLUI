# LLUI
LuaJIT Linux User Interface (LLUI, pronounced 'You Eye')

This repository is a comglomeration of several projects related to UI on Linux.
The intention is that with a single project, you could create anything from a framebuffer direct kiosk app, to a nicely behaved
windowing app that leverages OpenGL.
